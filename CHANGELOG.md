# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Structured tool responses (A1).** Every successful `tools/call`
  now emits `structuredContent` alongside the existing text content
  block, validating against the tool's advertised `outputSchema`.
  Old clients that read `content[0].text` keep working unchanged.
- **Full auth matrix on legacy HTTP (A2).** `MCP_TRANSPORT=http` now
  plumbs `authn.Authenticator` (static_bearer / oidc / forward_auth).
  `mtls` on legacy HTTP is rejected at config load with a recovery
  hint (terminate TLS upstream and use `forward_auth`, or use gRPC).
- **SSE GET origin/CORS parity (A3).** `GET /mcp` now applies the
  same `AllowedOrigins` list and CORS headers as `POST /mcp`.
- **Configurable OIDC verify-cache TTL (A4).**
  `MCP_OIDC_VERIFY_CACHE_TTL` replaces the hardcoded 60s ceiling
  (clamped to `[1s, 5m]`). Startup logs a warning when raised above
  the default so the revocation tradeoff is visible.
- **Transport × auth matrix test (A5).** Every supported and
  unsupported combination is locked down at `config.Load()`.
- **Per-subject rate-limiter eviction (B3).** Idle subject entries
  are reaped on a background ticker
  (`CLOCKIFY_SUBJECT_IDLE_TTL`, `CLOCKIFY_SUBJECT_SWEEP_INTERVAL`).
  The subjects map no longer grows unbounded.
- **SSE observability counters (B4).**
  `clockify_mcp_sse_subscriber_drops_total{reason}`,
  `clockify_mcp_sse_replay_misses_total`, and
  `clockify_mcp_sessions_reaped_total{reason}` surface hub / reaper
  eviction reasons that were previously silent.
- **File-store audit cap (B5).** `MCP_CONTROL_PLANE_AUDIT_CAP`
  bounds the in-memory audit slice on the file-backed control
  plane; FIFO eviction keeps dev deployments from growing forever.
- **Fail-closed dev-backend guard (C1).** `streamable_http` refuses
  to start against a `memory`/`file://` control plane unless
  `MCP_ALLOW_DEV_BACKEND=1` acknowledges the single-process limits.
- **Bootstrap + policy drift tests (D1).** Every name in
  `AlwaysVisible`, `MinimalSet`, `Tier1Catalog`, `introspection`,
  and `safeCoreWrites` must resolve to a registered tool.
- **`make verify-bench` Makefile target (D3).** Capture a baseline
  with `make bench BENCH_OUT=.bench/baseline.txt`, then
  `make verify-bench` diffs fresh profiles via `benchstat`.
- **Descriptor-runtime contract tests (D4).** `action` const in
  every outputSchema must match the tool name; Tier 2 descriptors
  must carry `readOnlyHint`/`destructiveHint`/`idempotentHint` in
  their Annotations map.
- **Protocol-version compat suite (E1).** Negotiation, capability
  shape, and dual-emit tools/call are now asserted across
  `2024-11-05`, `2025-03-26`, and `2025-06-18`.
- **ADR 0010 — metrics stack direction (E3, proposed).** Keep the
  homegrown metrics facade for v0.x; revisit with an OTel adapter
  on the ADR 0006 pattern at v1.0.

### Changed

- **Legacy HTTP `ServeHTTP` signature** now takes an
  `authn.Authenticator`. Callers that passed only a bearer token
  construct one via `authn.New(authn.Config{Mode: ModeStaticBearer, …})`.
- **`controlplane.Open` accepts options.** Add
  `controlplane.WithAuditCap(n)` to cap the file-backed audit
  slice; back-compat: zero args keeps the historical unbounded
  behaviour.

### Docs

- Auth × transport matrix in `docs/production-readiness.md` and
  `README.md` now matches the code. mTLS-on-legacy-http is
  documented as rejected; OIDC TTL + dev-backend knobs are
  listed in the main env-var table.

### Known remaining (follow-up session)

- Postgres control-plane backend (B1), audit retention / compaction
  (B2), `cmd/clockify-mcp/main.go` → `internal/runtime` split (C2),
  and versioned persistence subsystem (E2) are still open. See the
  roadmap at `/Users/15x/.claude/plans/a-deeper-read-changes-hidden-jellyfish.md`.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-04-12

Initial stable release.

> **Stability commitment.** The current API surface — tool names, resource URI templates, configuration env vars, delta-sync wire format, and JSON-RPC protocol behaviour — is now the v1 baseline. No breaking changes will be made without a major version bump. Tier 2 tool groups, the RFC 6902 JSON Patch delta format, and the gRPC transport are considered stable at this release.

### Highlights

- **124 tools** — 33 Tier 1 registered at startup, 91 Tier 2 activated on demand across 11 domain groups.
- **MCP capabilities**: `tools`, `resources` (2 concrete + 6 parametric URI templates), and `prompts` (5 built-in templates).
- **Transports**: stdio (default), streamable HTTP 2025-03-26, legacy POST-only HTTP, and opt-in gRPC (`-tags=grpc`).
- **Auth modes**: `static_bearer`, `oidc`, `forward_auth`, `mtls` — routed via a shared `authn.Authenticator` interface with per-stream validation on gRPC.
- **Four policy modes** (`read_only`, `safe_core`, `standard`, `full`) plus three-strategy dry-run for every destructive tool.
- **Three-layer rate limiting**: stdio dispatch semaphore, per-process concurrency + window limiter, and per-`Principal.Subject` sub-layer.
- **Stdlib-only default build** — the default binary links no OpenTelemetry, gRPC, or protobuf symbols. Verified in CI via `go tool nm`.
- **Opt-in observability**: OpenTelemetry tracing behind `-tags=otel`, Prometheus metrics always on, PII-scrubbed structured logs.
- **Signed releases** — cosign keyless signatures, SPDX SBOMs, and SLSA build provenance on every binary and container image.
- **Reference Kubernetes manifests** — Deployment (non-root distroless, read-only root FS), NetworkPolicy (default-deny), PodDisruptionBudget, ServiceMonitor, and PrometheusRule with multi-window burn-rate alerts for a 99.9% SLO. Helm chart and Kustomize overlays included.
